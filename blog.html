                <h3>ABOUT HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
                    It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
                    Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
                    A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
                    This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
                    Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable.
                    The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</p>

                    <h3>About CSS </h3>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS,
                        is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                        CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.
                        More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
                        It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more.
                        In short, you can make your website look however you want.
                        CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, 
                        including how elements are positioned in the browser.</p>
