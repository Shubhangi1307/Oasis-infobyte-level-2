                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Radhika, but people call me “ros” 
                    I’m a frontend developer, and I specialize in efficient React apps and CSS & HTML 
                    that just work across all platforms and browsers.
                    I care deeply about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.
                    My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for design and structure. 
                    I was sketching crazy detailed 3d models for fun when I was a kid, 
                    started building promo websites for small businesses while in school, 
                    then developed an app for my gaming guild in my university days.
                    For three years, I’ve worked for an e-commerce platform in Berlin,
                    where I was able to drive a 10% growth in sales by shaving five seconds from the website’s loading time. 
                    After that, I was in charge of implementing and launching the mobile app for a large European medical supply provider,
                    which I was able to complete in just under three months. Not that learning React Native at the same time made things easy for me.
                    Still, in the end, 
                    I was able to deliver an app that’s used by hundreds of distributors and direct customers daily and did so on-time and on-budget.
